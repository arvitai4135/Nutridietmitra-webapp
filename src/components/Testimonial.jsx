There have been weeks when I told her it's a lot for me to eat, can I eat less? I also like the innovative meal plan she shared which never makes you feel bored. She even shares the recipe links to make it easier for you. All the meals are easy to make from the ingredients readily available in our kitchens. I have lost 8kgs in 3.5-4 months (with a few cheat meals) but continue to follow her plan to make up for my cheat meals over weekends. I would recommend Tanu for a healthy lifestyle.",

        "I would like to thank Tanu Bhargava for all the advice. She planned my mom's diet chart, during her 3 months phase of Cancer Treatment. There are very few dieticians who provide such personal attention. I remember the treatment was going on at Mahavir Cancer Hospital, Tanu would send food from her kitchen and sometimes visit mom personally. The food was high quality, packed properly and was very tasty. Mom won't eat food provided by the hospital and she would gladly eat the food from Tanu's kitchen. With her advice in diet, mom's progress has been excellent. After radiation therapy mom is gaining weight and has no side effects. Better diet is the key for improvements in health and Tanu has made sure mom's diet plan is top notch. I would recommend Tanu to any Cancer Patient! God bless!",

Your diet plan made me eat my favorite Indian delicacies but yes in balanced proportion. I learnt that loosing weight doesn't mean you need to starve. Eat everything but you only need to count your calories and calories deficit is the only way to loose excess fat. Your support and guidance is really valuable ma'am and I feel motivated since the time I am associated with you. We started loving our bodies :-) You have made a positive difference in our lives. Thank you so much for everything !! I am your proud happy client :-)",

She has been a go to person for me whenever I feel that I am deviating from the healthy lifestyle. The best part of her diet charts that I have noticed is that she will not make you starve in order to loose weight infact she will balance the calories in such manner so you don't feel hungry at all and you still end up loose weight on the other hand. The amazing and high rich nutritious drinks that she included in my diet chart were so mouth watering and healthy that I always looked upto 11AM slot of my diet so I can have it :-) I highly recommend this extremely experience lady if any of you are looking for a dietician to help you get back to a healthy lifestyle. Many thanks Tanu for showing me the significance of healthy lifestyle!",
